# compilers

Repository used for Compilers (Compiladores) University course. The focus is on language theory, aiming to equip students with the ability to design and implement syntax-directed translators, with a focus on compiler construction. The objectives include:

1. The ability to work with regular languages, including manipulating computational models used to describe and recognize them, such as regular expressions, finite automata, and regular grammars.
2. The ability to work with context-free languages, both in their interpretation and design.
3. The ability to distinguish lexical analysis and syntactic analysis.
4. Proficiency in effectively using ANTLR4 to design and implement syntax-directed translators, including compilers.

Achieved final grade of 15 out of 20
